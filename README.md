Project Name: Inventory Management System (Java)

Short Description:
This is a console-based Java application developed to manage product inventory in a store.
The system allows adding products, updating stock quantity, selling products, and viewing inventory details.
Data is stored using file handling so that inventory information is preserved after program restart.
This project demonstrates my understanding of Core Java concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming, ArrayList, file handling, and exception handling.
